age_wpa_pos.png 
- this plot shows the wpa distribution of errors based on ages and split by positions

etype_wpa_pos.ong
- this boxplot breaks the errors into different types and shows which type of errors certain positions experience

pred_age_wpa.png
- this plot came from a logistic regression model where I was looking to see if there was any link between age and the amount of win probability added on each 
error. This plot shows that there is nothing substantial for certain positions and ages. 

woba_error_years.png
- an idea I had was to look at the xWOBA on plays that were determined errors to see if there was a treshold where certain plays are seen as too difficult
to be deemed an error. There are more variables to that idea. This plot shows the distribution of xWOBA on the position level and split by year. This shows
different trends year to year where certain positions are seeing more errors.
